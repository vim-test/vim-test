INTRODUCTION                                    *test*

This plugin allows you to:

  * run nearest test (to the cursor)
  * run (current) test file
  * run test suite
  * run last test

It comes with most common test runners already built in, so it knows which
test runner it has to use for the file you're looking at.

Add your preferred mappings to your `.vimrc` file:
>
  nmap <silent> <leader>t :TestNearest<CR>
  nmap <silent> <leader>T :TestFile<CR>
  nmap <silent> <leader>a :TestSuite<CR>
  nmap <silent> <leader>l :TestLast<CR>

GENERIC COMMANDS                                *test-generic_commands*

In all commands [args] are forwarded to the underlying test runner.

                                                *test-:TestNearest*
:TestNearest [args]          Run a test nearest to the cursor (some test
                             runners may not support this). If the current
                             file is not a test file, it reruns a previous
                             "nearest test" (if present).

                                                *test-:TestFile*
:TestFile [args]             Run tests for the current file. If the current
                             file is not a test file, it runs tests for a
                             previously "touched" test file (if present).

                                                *test-:TestSuite*
:TestSuite [args]            Run test suite of the current file. If the current
                             file is not a test file, it runs the suite for
                             the last "touched" test file (if present).

                                                *test-:TestLast*
:TestLast [args]             Run the last test.

STRATEGIES                                      *test-strategies*

Multiple strategies are supported for running tests. If you're using MacVim GUI,
you can tell test.vim to send commands to Terminal.app/iTerm.

Dispatch ~
>
  let g:test#strategy = 'dispatch'
<
Vimux ~
>
  let g:test#strategy = 'vimux'
<
Tslime ~
>
  let g:test#strategy = 'tslime'
<
Terminal.app ~
>
  let g:test#strategy = 'terminal'
<
iTerm ~
>
  let g:test#strategy = 'iterm'
<
CONFIGURATION                                   *test-configuration*

You may find yourself specifying certain options for your test runners in
certain situations. You can configure your prefered options with
>
  let g:test#minitest#options = '--verbose'
<
Or, if you prefer more granular approach, you can do
>
  let g:test#rspec#options = {
    \ 'nearest': '--format documentation',
    \ 'file':    '--format documentation',
    \ 'suite':   '--tag ~slow',
  \}
<
If you want to manually configure a test runner's executable, you can do
>
  let g:test#rspec#executable = 'script/my_rspec'

CREDITS                                         *test-credits*

Thanks to Gary Bernhardt, the person who invented this kind of testing.
I also want to thank vim-rspec (https://github.com/thoughtbot/vim-rspec), from
which I borrowed GUI support for OS X, and Windows support.
